Approach:

1. Store the root in a cur Node and try to create an iteration using stack to traverse the tree the way you want it. 
2. The reason behind using stack is that you would want the left elements entered last to be printed first.
3. Creating the optimized traversal loop is the challenging part.

Time Complexity: O(N);
Space Complexity: O(N);
