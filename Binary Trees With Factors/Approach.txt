Approach:

1. Create a map to store the number of trees which can be formed with each array element as a root node.
2. Update the map if you find a factor in the array for the current element and store the updated number of trees which can be formed. 
3. return the sum of all the elements of the map.

Time complexity: O(N**1.5);
Space complexity: O(N);

Solution is found using 2D Dynamic Programming.
