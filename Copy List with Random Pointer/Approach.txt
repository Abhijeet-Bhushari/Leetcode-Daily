Approach:

Using No extra space:
1. Create a new linked list using the next pointer where the random is still assigned to NULL. 
2. To assign random pointer to it's correct pointer, use two track pointers where the track2 is following track1 in it's own list.
3. When the Node is found by track1 then track2 is assigned as random to temp.

Using extra space: 
1. Use a map data structure to map each Node of List1 to each Node of List2.
2. When you want to assign random pointer just assign it the mapped Node of List2 to temp2->random.

Time Complexity: O(N);      O(N*N);
Space Complexity: O(N);     O(1);
