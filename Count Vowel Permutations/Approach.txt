Approach: 

1. First I solved the problem through recursion and memoized the recursion approach. The time complexity was herendous.
2. The Intended solution solves this problem through maintaining the count of last occuring characters. Very nice solution. I still am amazed 
at how people can devise such solutions. Great indeed. 

Time Complexity: O(N);
Space Complexity: O(1);

To understand the solution draw the transition tree of which characters follow and all the strings possible. 
Try finding a way to store the count of all the last occuring a, e, i, o and u's. That's your answer.
