Approach: 

1. Take some time to think about the problem and you will realize that you can reduce the k to executable amount
2. Traverse the string and calculate the size of the encoded string. 
3. Traverse the string in reverse and divide the size by the digit if the value is a digit.
4. Similarly reduce k by modulo the size of the current encoded string. 

Very Intuitive Approach
Greedy solution

Time Complexity: O(N);
Space Complexity: O(1);
