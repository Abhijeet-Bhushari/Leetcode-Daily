Approach:

1. Great question: why? because I had never done this before and I always feared this question. I always feared that 
I would be never able to get it. 

2. Turns out that you just need to try solving a question and not think about it. 

3. Solved through separate chaining implemented using vector of vectors. 

4. The most optimal way of solving this would be to use balanced BSTs instead of vectors. 

Time Complexity: O(N);
Space Complexity: O(N);
