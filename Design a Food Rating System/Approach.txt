Approach:

1. Using the priority queue is very intuitive but the only problem is updating the entered values when rating change takes place.
2. Don't worry about the updation and just enter duplicate values in the queue. 
3. Now while removing the values from the p queue, return the correct values only. 

Time Complexity: changeRating: O(2 * log(N));
                 highestRating: log(N)^2;
Space Complexity: O(N);
