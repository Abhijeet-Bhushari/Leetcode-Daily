Approach: 

1. Use binary search to find the peak first and then find the target element by binary search in the two sorted arrays.
2. To minimize the number of API calls use caching to store the values. 
3. It's really an easy problem and it's just hard because we are using an API interface instead of an array.
Great solution!!!!! I am the best!!! :)

Time Complexity: O(N * Log(N));
Space Complexity: O(1);
