Approach:

1. This is a great problem for optimization. 
2. Brute force solution would be to just implement what the problem asks.
3. A better solution would be solving it in O(N) space rather than O(M*N) space.
4. Another solution would be to mask the modified value in the same integer space.

Great problem. I loved it. 

Time Complexity: O(M*N);
Space Complexity: O(1);
