Approach:

1. Use 2 queues q1 and q1
2. q1 will act as a primary queue and q2 will act as a support
3. for pop(), transfer all but the last element to q2 from q1. pop the last element. swap roles of q1 and q2.
4. for top(), transfer all the elements from q1 to q2. swap roles. return last element.

Time complexity:
push(): O(1)
pop(): O(n)
top(): O(n)
empty(): O(1)

Space complexity: O(n)
