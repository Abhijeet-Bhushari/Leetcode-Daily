Approach:

1. We understand that the brute force approach will be to create the entire string and find the element. Not feasible. 
2. For each string calculate which part contributes to the final element till you reach the element. 
3. use the relation that each element will contribute equally in the final string. remove the unrequired half.

Time complexity: O(N);
Space complexity: O(1);
