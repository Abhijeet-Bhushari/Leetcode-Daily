Approach:

1. We need to check for each center what is the largest palindrome formed around it is.
2. To do this we start from the center and move outwards. when we find that right and left do not match anymore then break.
3. Save the string which is the longest palindrome around that center if it is the longest palindrome till now. 

Note: starting to check if string is palindrome is there from the center is important to achieve constant time for larger palindrome.

Time complexity: O(N*N);
Space Complexity: O(1);
