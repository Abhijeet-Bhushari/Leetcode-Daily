Approach: 

1. Simple problem where the brute force is very intuitive and solvable
2. To reduce the time complexity from O(N*N) to O(N*Log(N)) sort the flowers array.
3. Get the flowers that bloomed before the person arrived and the flowers rotted before that person arrived. 
4. The difference of bloomed and rotted is the answer to that person. 

Time Complexity: O(M + N*log(N));
Space Complexity: O(1);
