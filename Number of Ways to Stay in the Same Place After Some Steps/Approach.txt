Approach: 

1. Firstly we know that we need to keep track of 2 variables which are remaining steps and position.
2. Use top-down dynamic programming approach to get the number of possible steps for each position.
3. Return the steps for starting at 0 with steps number of remaining steps.

Time Complexity: O(3^N);
Space Complexity: O(N*N);
