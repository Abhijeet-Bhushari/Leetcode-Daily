Approach

1. Through trial and error find the minimum number of pigs for a fixed number of trials for different number of buckets. 
2. You will get a relation between how the number of pigs required increases with the buckets. that's the solution.

Time complexity: O(log(n)base(Trials + 1));
Space complexity: O(1);
