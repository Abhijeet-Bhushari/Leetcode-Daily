Approach:

1. Store the adjacent elements to each element in a map to access it in less time.
2. Start from the element which has a single adjacent element and set current to that adjacent element.
3. Like this push all the elements to the final answer vector. 

Time complexity: O(N);
Space complexity: O(N);
