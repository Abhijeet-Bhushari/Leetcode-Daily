Approach:

1. Use a data structure which allows you to get the minimum unreserved seat in constant time. 
2. Unreserving a seat should take minimum time possible which in this case would be O(log(N)).

Time complexity: O(N + q*log(q));
Space complexity: O(N);

At first, I tried to solve this problem using a vector but the problem with vector is that no matter how much we optimize the minimum found function 
it won't be O(1) at any cost. so using another data structure seems like an obvious choice.
