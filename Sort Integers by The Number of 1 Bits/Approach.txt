Approach:

1. Realize that the time complexity which will be required minimum will be N*log(N)*log(A)
2. Sort the array using custom comparator by calculating the hamming weights of each element and comparing them.
3. If both hamming weights are equal return a < b

Time complexity: O(N*log(N*A));
Space complexity: O(1);
