Approach: 

1. Easy question so just iterate through each row and use binary search to find the last 1.
2. Store the position of last 1 in a pair list with position, row_index.
3. Sort the list.
4. create a res of size k and store the row_index in it and return it.

Time Complexity: O(N*log(M));
Space Complexity: O(N);
