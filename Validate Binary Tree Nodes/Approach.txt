Approach: 

1. Find the nodes which can be reached from each node and find the root node by using the fact that it won't be the child of any other node. 
2. use recursion to iterate over the tree and if the number of nodes iterated is not equal to the number of nodes given then return false.

Time Complexity: O(N);
Space Complexity: O(N);
